## Tech Stack

ShutterWing Photos is built with modern web technologies for a nice experience:

- **Frontend**: React + Vite for fast, responsive UI development.
- **Backend**: JavaScript (Node.js) for handling data, uploads, and server logic.
- Additional tools: Supports SMTP for emails, privacy-focused features, and admin tools for moderation.
